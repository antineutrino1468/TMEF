Sure it does what it sets to do good, you can farm, plow, sow, and harvest; grow animals, deforest the whole map (Which is my favorite), and sell the fruits of said labor. Yet its just soo jankey and limited compared to later games. Games that while I have played for an hour or two at a freinds house, I can still say do the farming simulator genre much more then this. A obvious statment yes; that newer things will be better then older things due to inovation. But I don't think this game needs that inovation to be good. It just needs to not be janky and a bore with the same repetative items over and over again. Like to be fair, if the forestry mechines didn't constantly glitch out like a rat on crack then I would have played way more of this then I ended up, and I might have even made some of the acheivments, but no. On the bright side however, I have yet to have as much fun in a multiplayer game then I had playing this with a freind a few years back while just messing around.",
